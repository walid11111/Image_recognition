Introduction
The Image Recognition project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify images into predefined categories. This implementation is written in a Jupyter Notebook, making it interactive and beginner-friendly.

Features
Preprocessing images (e.g., resizing, normalization, and augmentation).
Training a custom machine learning model.
Evaluating the model's accuracy and visualizing results.
Generating predictions on unseen data.
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or later
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python libraries:
TensorFlow or PyTorch
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Installation
